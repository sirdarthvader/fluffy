# Fluffy, No BS React Framework

Tools like Next.js or Remix are popular but might have complexities or features that some developers find overwhelming. The user's framework should strip away those complexities but keep essential features. So maybe focus on routing, SSR, and state management, but in a simpler way.

CORE principles.

- The framework should be minimalist, so avoid adding too many features.
- Convention over configuration might help, but also allow flexibility.
- Performance is crucial, so build-time optimizations and efficient bundling.
- Dev experience: hot reloading, clear errors, good CLI tools.
